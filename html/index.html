        <h3>Who We Are</h3>
        <p>Pillars Care Foundation is an independent registered non-governmental, 
            non-political, non-religious and non-profit <br> civil society
             based In Migori – Kenya East Africa.</p>
        <h3>Our Vision and Mission</h3>
        <p>Our Vision</p>
        <p>Creation of a healthy empowered youth population participating in agribusiness,
             environmental conservation <br> and sustainable development.</p>
        <p>Our Mission</p>
        <p>Contributing to the education of young people, through a value system based,
             to help build a better world <br> where people are self-fulfilled as individuals and play constructive role in
              rehabilitating the Environment <br> and
              restoring the youths back to Agriculture.</p>
              <h3>What We Do</h3>
              <ul>
                <li><p>Advocate and campaign for greater recognition, funding and opportunities for nature-based activities.</p></li>
                <li><p>Provide expert advice, support and a free membership scheme to support communities to grow in sustainable ways.</p></li>
                <li><p>Design and deliver innovative training programs which empower and enable communities to thrive and grow.</p></li>
                <li><p>Forge pathways for our members to access commissioned services and demonstrate that they deliver high quality provision.</p></li>
              </ul>
              <h3>Improving People's Lives</h3>
              <p>Many people assume that community gardens and city or care farms are just 
                nice places to visit where plants are grown and animals kept. But that is far
                 from the whole picture. <br><br> Many of them also offer an amazing array of benefits 
                 and opportunities, which can include education programs, play schemes, healthy living initiatives, work and skills training,
                  social enterprises, volunteer opportunities, environmental schemes, horticultural therapy groups, facilities for people with 
                disabilities…the list goes on and on!</p>
                <h3>Our History</h3>
                <p>Together, we have a combined history of over 3 years’ experience in advocacy, 
                    lobbying, membership growth, support and capacity building, and working with 
                    sector partners. By merging, we are able to offer a range of services for 
                    members, government and the wider sector. A key strength of Pillars Care is 
                    that we work with and support a diverse membership base across the whole of
                     the Kenya, working across both urban and rural settings. <br><br> Our members operate
                      across a wide spectrum, offering services including Green Care, community 
                      and social based activities. There is often considerable crossover in
                       delivery different settings. For example, a community farm may be involved
                        in both community development and care farming activities. By focusing on
                         the services or activities delivered or facilitated by our members, 
                         rather than the physical form upon which our members operate
                          (e.g. a farm, garden, school, orchard), we aim to widen
                     the opportunities open to our members and the wider sector.</p>
