                    <h3><u>DAY OF THE AFRICAN CHILD</u></h3>
                    <p class="techText">
                        16 June is the Day of the African Child (DAC). It is a day to promote children’s rights and take stock of the efforts being made to protect and promote them across the continent. 

Now is a crucial time for children in the face of challenges such as the COVID-19 pandemic, climate crises and food shortages – all of which are impacting the safety and wellbeing of children in Africa and beyond. The number of children involved in child labour has gone up for the first time in two decades - and Africa has the highest number of children affected.
 Child marriage rates are threatening to increase globally and in the region, and practices such as female genital mutilation remain prevalent.

But despite challenges, action is taking place to foster progress. And this year’s DAC theme - “eliminating harmful practices affecting children: progress on policy and practice since 2013” reflects this momentum.

In western Kenya region we are  joining hands with the End Violence Partnership by making formal public commitments to ending all forms of violence against children through national policy and planning. 

Being a Pathfinding country means we are committed to provide a child friendly environment that allows children to not only survive, but also thrive.


The region is also accelerating action to eliminate corporal punishment or violent forms of discipline. Corporal punishment is the most common form of violence against children and it takes place across settings – including at home, in schools, care institutions, and juvenile justice systems – often perpetrated by caregivers. 

Kenya have legally  prohibited corporal punishment in all settings and many more are taking steps. Just weeks ago, kenya passed children act  2022 and Children’s Code Bill respectively – include provisions to prohibit corporal punishment in all settings. 

On this Day of the African Child 2022, the End Violence Partnership is celebrating progress and calling on all countries in the region to enact legislations that ban all forms of harmful practices affecting children, including corporal punishment and PCF is joining othe development partners to maki this day in kisumu county , Seme subcounty , osiri primary where learners from different schools came together to make the day
